\subsection{ROS system structure overview}
ROS is a set of conventions and tools for building complex robot control systems.
In a system built on ROS, the primary building block of the system is the “node”.
A bunch of nodes working together concurrently make up a complete ROS-based
robot control system.
A node is a Linux process that performs some logically separable task. Nodes
communicate by message passing using a well defined protocol. This is primarily
intended for isolation and concurrency, but it has the neat side effect of
providing programming language interoperability—a node written in COBOL will
work fine (and you'll never even know) as long as it does the message passing
correctly
